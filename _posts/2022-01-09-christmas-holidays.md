### Tasks
- Display Modifications
- Setup Medical Training Quiz Structure

### Summary
Over the christmas holidays I worked on displaying the modifications in a social media style and setting up the structure for the medical training (quizzes).

Displaying the modifications meant some changing of the modifications structure to just find the new modifications for that day and clearing the new modifications after that day.
I created a very basic looking social media feed with a stethoscope for an icon and a tablet to temporarily represent the profile picture. I also added this display into the tablet view in the game so the player can refer back to the new information whilst playing.

Finally I also added in a 'training' system which is essentially a quiz system where the player can test their knowledge. It is important that new topics aren't introduced in this training system, since topics should be introduced in the main game, but giving players a place where they can test their knowledge on the topics they've been introduced to will help them reinforce their understanding.
