### Tasks
- Begin research into gamification 

### Summary
To start off my project over the summer I have focused on research into gamification and it's applications in education. 

After beginning my research I realised what I want to achieve through my project is not classified as gamification; a more suitable term to look into would be 'game based learning'. I will also look into serious games and educational games. Through my initial research I have already found useful information around how games can be used in education and the benefits of doing so.

I have also been evalutating current examples of both educational games and sex education based games. There does not seem to be many sex education based games that aim to teach sex education in a fun and engaging way.

### Next Steps
- Focus research on 'game based learning', serious games and educational games.
