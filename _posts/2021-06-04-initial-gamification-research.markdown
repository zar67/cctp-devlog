### Tasks
- Begin research into gamification 

### Summary
To start off my project I have focused on research into gamification applications in education. 

After beginning to research I realised what I want to achieve through my project is not classified as gamification. A more suitable term to look into would be 'game based learning'.

I have also been evalutating current examples of both educational games and sex education based games. 

### Next Steps
- Focus research on 'game based learning', serious games and educational games.
