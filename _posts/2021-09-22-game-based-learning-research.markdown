### Tasks
- Research game based learning

### Summary
After some initial research I have begun looking into game based learning which is a more suitable terminology to use for the project I want to create. I have found useful information regarding the effectiveness of Game Based Learning as well as tips and techniques for implementing Game Based Learning.

I have also started creating a mind map of ideas and thoughts about possible topics I could base my game upon as well as potential game genres would suit the project.

### Next Steps
- Setup first supervisor meeting with Lloyd
- Continue with game based learning research
