### Tasks
- Research game-based learning

### Summary
After some initial research I have begun looking into game-based learning which is a more suitable terminology to use for the project I want to create. I have found useful information regarding the effectiveness of game-based Learning as well as tips and techniques for implementing game-based Learning.

As stated in the previous log the Haruna et al article provided some evidence not only that game-based learning is a good approach to improvement engagement and learning in education, but also that sex education can benefit from gamification and game-based learning.

After reading this article I continued to look into game-based learning and came across an article by Gavin Cahill titled "Why Game-Based Learning". Cahill discusses why game-based learning should be used; games have been used as learning tools for centuries, games provide active learning instead of passive learning, games address all of the learning styles at the same time, students can experiment through trial and error, and more.
Reference: Cahill, G. (2021) Why Game-Based Learning. Available from: https://thelearningcounsel.com/article/why-game-based-learning [Accessed 17 July 2021].

As well as researching, I have started creating a mind map of ideas and thoughts about possible topics I could base my game upon as well as potential game genres would suit the project. Here they are:

</p>

  <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/game-genres-mind-map.png" alt="Game Genres Mind Map"/>
</p>

These mind maps are a collection of all ideas, and so not all the topics I have sugested may be suitable for the target audience I intend to make this game for. However, these topics can be refined and eliminated as the university term starts and I have more information about the CCTP module. 

### Next Steps
- Research current sex education curriculum requirements
