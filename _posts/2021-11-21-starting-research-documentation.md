### Tasks
- Research more into types of learning and cognitive thinking.
- Research the theory of game-based learning. 
- Begin prototyping patients in Unity project.

### Summary
This week I focused on researching learning styles and learning theory. I found conflicting results about learning styles and whether to make my final artefact adaptive to learning styles of the users. 

I found several papers debating the existance of learning styles entirely, arguing there is a sufficient lack of reliable research that concludes adapting learning techniques to learning styles provide great benefits. An article by Pashler and Rohrer (2009) called Learning Styles: Concepts and Evidence also stated that modifiying teaching paedeology to accomodate learning styles would be very logistically demading and so there would need to be a great benefit to student learning to be practical, which so far there is very little reliable research to support. 

Due to this I think that adapting the final arefact to learning styles would not be practical or beneficial expecially since Cahill's 2021 "Why Game-Based Learning?" article also suggested that games-based learning techniques often accomodate most learning styles through the nature of game design.

This week I have also been working on my prototype, setting up a working game loop with patients coming in and leaving on player actions. I setup some basic patient data that means making new patients is easy and the patients are currently randomly generated.
