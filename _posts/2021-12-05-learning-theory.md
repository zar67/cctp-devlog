### Tasks
- Continue writing research sections of research documentation (literature review and findings).
- Add profile data to prototype.

### Summary
This week I mainly wanted to focus on the literature review part of my reserach doumentation, I formulated a list of things I wanted to include and realise I had some gaps in my research. I focused my research this week on how we actually learn and how that links into games. I found three common learning theories: classical conditioning, operant conditioning and learning by observation. 

I wrote up a document summarising all my research into clear points that I could easily find and pull out of the document, I then wrote the majority of my literature review. It ended up being very long and so I think I'll need to condense it down later.

Finally this week I also have been populating the profile data for my prototype, adding in a saving system and updating the UI to display stats like time played, patients helped etc. 

### Next Steps
- First draft of research documentation.
- Work on day modifications for prototype.
