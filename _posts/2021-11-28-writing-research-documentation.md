### Tasks
- Discuss Research Documentation With Lloyd.
- Start Research Documentation:
    - Fill out research methodology and ethics.
    - Begin formulating an idea of the research to inlude.
- Finalise research question.
- Research how gamification works and why it works.

### Summary
This week started with meeting Lloyd to discuss more about the research documentation and the prototype work I had done so far. We discussed the research documentation, what I'd done so far and it gave me a good direction to head in next; I want to start collating my research into the documentation this week and filling out the template given on blackboard. I also want to think about my research question a bit more, to get that finalised this week.

He also gave me some more ideas for increasing engagement with my prototype:
1. Having a set number of patients each day and giving the player some time at the start of the day to look through the patients and see what's coming.
2. Having information about the topics given in the tablet view, allowing the player to research more about the topics through the day and before patients start coming in.
3. Having some sort of tutorial to teach player's what to do.

We also discussed user testing with teachers and students. Closer to the time I want to reach out to schools to ask teachers to user test my artefact, so I need to include this in my research documentation. 

I started my research documentation this week, writing out a draft research methodology and ethics sections as well as starting the literature review. The ethical considerations I focused on were:
- Participants of user testing with data and consent.
- Content appropriateness for the target audience.
- Religous views and sex education content.

I also setup a draft questionnaire for the user testing I want to complete, which I added into the appendix section.

Finally this week I also worked on my prototype, adding in point 1 of Lloyds feedback and also adding in an events system where certain actions taken by the player will lead to events being generated, these events are stored in a save file so will persist after the player quits the game.

### Next Steps
- Continue writing research sections of research documentation (literature review and findings).
