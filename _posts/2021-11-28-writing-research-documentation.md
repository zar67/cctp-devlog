### Tasks
- Discuss Research Documentation With Lloyd.
- Start Research Documentation:
    - Fill out research methodology and ethics.
    - Begin formulating an idea of the research to inlude.
- Finalise research question.
- Research how gamification works and why it works.

### Summary
This week started with meeting Lloyd to discuss more about the research documentation and the prototype work I had done so far. We discussed the research documentation, what I'd done so far and it gave me a good direction to head in next; I want to start collating my research into the documentation this week and filling out the template given on blackboard. I also want to think about my research question a bit more, to get that finalised this week.

He also gave me some more ideas for increasing engagement with my prototype for example:
- Having a set number of patients each day and giving the player some time at the start of the day to look through the patients and see what's coming.
- Having information about the topics given in the tablet view, allowing the player to research more about the topics through the day and before patients start coming in.
- Having some sort of tutorial to teach player's what to do.

We also discussed user testing with teachers and students. Closer to the time I want to reach out to schools to ask teachers to user test my artefact, so I need to include this in my research documentation. 

### Next Steps
- Continue writing research sections of research documentation (literature review and findings).
