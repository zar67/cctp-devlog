### Tasks
- First draft of research documentation.
- Work on day modifications for prototype.

### Summary
This week I finished up a first draft of my research documentation including some research on UI design, game design, flow etc. 

This week I also worked on my prototype by adding in modifications, or the ability to add or remove topics. This is useful for a difficulty curve where I can add in new topics after a certain number of days or other triggers.

Finally this week I have also been working on an avatar system for the player and the patients, and have managed to get it working. Now the patients look more like actual people instead of a white blob.
