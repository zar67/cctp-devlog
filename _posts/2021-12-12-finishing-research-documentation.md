### Tasks
- First draft of research documentation.
- Work on day modifications for prototype.

### Summary
This week I finished up a first draft of my research documentation including some research on UI design, game design, flow etc. 

This week I also worked on my prototype by adding in modifications, or the ability to add or remove topics. This is useful for a difficulty curve where I can add in new topics after a certain number of days or other triggers.

### Next Steps
- Research Art Styles in games and decide on an art style for the game.
- Review and complete Research Documentation.
- Submit Research Documentation.
