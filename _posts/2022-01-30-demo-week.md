### Tasks
- Do Demo

### Summary
This week started with the demo presentation, I showed my video and got feedback from Lloyd and Beth:

- I am correct in not wanting to punish the player too much since this is a learning game.
- I should think about some tutorial or key in order to make the actions clearer.
- I should do some testing to see what people think of the UI design, whether it is intuitive. 

I didn't do any more work on my prototype over the week.

### Next Steps
- Add In Advice Action for Player
- Implement the difficulty curve by adding more STIs to handle.
