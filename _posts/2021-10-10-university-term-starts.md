### Tasks
- Research current sex education curriculum requirements

### Summary
This week has been the second week of the university starting block, I haven't made a lot of progress regarding research this week as I have been settling back into uni life.

However, I have managed to research the current sex and relationships curriculum in the UK and analyse it.
*TBD*

### Next Steps
- Setup an initial supervisory meeting with Lloyd.
- Look at previous projects and proposals as well as the proposal template provided on Blackboard.
