### Tasks
- Add to the risks and issues section of the proposal
- Research project management, testing, and development techniques
- Fill out the methods, techniques, tools and process section of the proposal

### Summary
This week I planned to focus on writing my proposal and creating a first, full, draft to send to Lloyd for feedback.

Firstly, I added to the risks and issues section of my proposal, creating 3 clear risks for my project:
- The broad subject area.
- The difficulty with testing with children.
- The difficulty of successfully implementing gamification techniques.

I then added to the methods, techniques, tools and process section of the proposal, referencing tools such as Git and Trello and processes such as GitFlow and Agile development.
With my first full draft of my proposal complete I sent it off to Lloyd for some feedback.

I also did some work on thinking about the final artefact I want to produce and started writing up some game design ideas. 
My idea is to create a Paper's Please style puzzle simulation where the player works in a sexual health clinic, patients will come in with their symptoms or problems and the player will have to diagnose them or provide them with a solution, this could include giving out contraceptives, prescribing medication for STIs or giving information regarding other services that can help. As another design element, I think the players actions should be seen to affect the world around them - for example if the player fails to give contraceptives to a young girl asking for them she may come in on a later day pregnant.

I spend some time this week documenting my ideas into a simple GDD and drawing up the GUI I would need for this idea.

Lastly this week, I continued looking into the current SRE curriculum and drew up a list of learning objectives I want my project to achieve:
- Should know about menstrual wellbeing including the key facts about the menstrual cycle.
- Should know key facts about puberty, the changing adolescent body and menstrual wellbeing.
- Should know the facts about the full range of contraceptive choices, efficacy and options available.
- Should know the facts around pregnancy including miscarriage.
- Should know that there are choices in relation to pregnancy (with medically and legally accurate, impartial information on all options, including keeping the baby, adoption, abortion and where to get further help).
- Should know how the different sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV and AIDs, are transmitted, how risk can be reduced through safer sex (including through condom use) and the importance of and facts about testing.
- Should know about the prevalence of some STIs, the impact they can have on those who contract them and key facts about treatment.
- Should know how to get further advice, including how and where to access confidential sexual and reproductive health advice and treatment.

These may be changed and reduced as I begin development of my project, however these are the topics I am interested about implementing.

### Next Steps
- Continue formulating game design
- Improve Proposal with feedback from Lloyd
