### Tasks
- Research SRE teaching methods
- Add to the risks and issues section of the proposal
- Research project management, testing, and development techniques
- Fill out the methods, techniques, tools and process sections of the proposal

### Summary
This week I planned to focus on writing my proposal and creating a first, full, draft to send to Lloyd for feedback.

Firstly, there were two more areas I wanted to research before diving in to finishing up my proposal draft. The first area I wanted to look into was the teaching methods (paedology) used for SRE.
