### Tasks
- Research Art Styles in games and decide on an art style for the game.
- Review and complete Research Documentation.

### Summary
This week I submitted my research documentation after making some final tweaks to it. 

I have also decided on a vector art style for the game, an example of which can be seen by the generic items pack from Kenney below:

This week I have also been working on notifications for my prototype, it's a bit early to be working on such meta elements but since I knew it would be a quick and easy tasks I decided to work on it this week while I focused on finalising my research documentation.
