### Tasks
- More theoretical research into game-based learning and gamification.
- Research into types of learning and their links to games.
- Creation of the office game environment in the Unity project.

### Summary
This week I didn't get much work done on my project due to time limitations with other modules. I did however manage to begin prototyping the office scene in Unity with draggable objects on the desk, as seen below:

I also had a brief look at some articles on learning styles and their relations to games. I need to dive further into this topic to understand it more, but I did find out the way people with different learning styles respond to a set number of genre's through Seyed Mohammadbagher Jafari, Zahra Abdollahzade's article "Investigating the relationship between learning style and game type in the game-based learning environment". It stated that Puzzle and Simulation games were very popular with most learners in the Felder-Silverman learning styles model, which is ideal for the puzzle-simulation game my design is heading towards.

There is also a broader discussion on how to adapt games for different learning styles and cognitive thinking styles, which is something I want to explore more and think about the complexities of implementing into my project.

I plan to do more next week after the lecture on the research documentation, as I will have a clearer idea of what I need to produce.

### Next Steps
- Research more into types of learning and cognitive thinking.
- Research the theory of game-based learning. 
- Begin prototyping patients in Unity project.
