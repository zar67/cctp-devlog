### Tasks
- Add advice slip printouts
- Close popups on tap

### Summary
This week I added in an advice slip that spawns when the user selects an advice option in the advice book. This spawns on to the desk so that the user can then drag the slip to the patient. This works better than just selecting the option in the book since it conforms to the standard of dragging items to the patients to treat them. 

I also added another popup for when the user taps on a symptom, to give them more information about that symptom. Eventually the symptoms will have icons to show the user the different symptoms, and tapping on the symptom will show a text description but currently the symptom shows the description too. 

Finally this week I changed the popups so that tapping on the background of the popup will close the popup and for popups that require no interation tapping anywhere on the screen will close it. This makes it easier for the user to close the popups then tapping on the small close button. 

### Next Steps
- Attend report lecture
- Prepare for testing
- Start writing report
