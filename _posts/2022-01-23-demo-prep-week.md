### Tasks
- Add In SRE Content
- Add In Test Kits

### Summary
This week I started by adding in some SRE content. I added in the different STIs I wanted to include in the game as well as their symptoms and treatments. Each action the player can take is mapped to an effectivness (WORST, BAD, NETURAL, GOOD, BEST), only the BEST actions will cure the patient.

This week I also added in the opportunity for testing. The idea behind this is that if the player is very stuck they can give the patient a test to determine what affliction they have, but they need to give the patient the correct type of test (blood, swab or urine) to be useful as not all test can detect all STIs.

This week I also made my demo video to show Lloyd and Beth next week. That can be found here: <a href="https://youtu.be/gcrv0VpAQRI" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/gcrv0VpAQRI</a>
