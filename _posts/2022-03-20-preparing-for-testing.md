### Tasks
- Attend report lecture
- Prepare for testing
- Start writing report

### Summary
This week started with a lecture about the report, how to structure it, what to write and more. After the lecture I opened the template and started filling in the information I could, including some of the research and ethics sections with work I had done previously. 

This week I mainly started preparing for testing, I started with deciding on how I wanted to user test the game and what the questions I needed answers, these questions are:
- Is the game easy to understand for new players?
- Does the user learn while playing the game?
- Does the user improve as they play more? 

I also want to gain any feedback relating to bugs in the game or improvements that could be made. 

I wrote a first draft of the participant information sheet and consent form to be given to people before they participate in the user testing.

Finally this week I built my game to device and began testing myself just to make sure everything was working. I found some bugs and some sticking points that the player might not understand and so fixed these, they were:
- The ID's of the patients weren't unique and so on Day 2 sometimes there were errors.
- The different colours of the testing kits weren't clear.
- How to give advice to the patient wasn't clear if you didn't see the advice slip slide up.
- The notification schedule time was too low and became annoying quickly.

### Next Steps
- Speak to Lloyd about user testing and ensure the participant information sheet and consent form are correct.
- Start user testing.
