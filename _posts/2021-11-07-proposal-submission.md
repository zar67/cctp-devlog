### Tasks
- Submit proposal
- Discuss research documentation and demo with Lloyd
- Make GitHub repository and empty Unity project
- Finalise SRE topics to cover
- Work on finalising game design
- Create Trello board
- Identify core game mechanics for Demo submission
- Look at research report assessment criteria

### Summary
This week I met with Lloyd for one final discussion about my proposal before the submission, we discussed some feedback he had already given me and offered some final small tweaks before the submission. I also propsed my game idea to him and we dicussed the logistics and potential additions to the idea.

After the meeting I looked more into existing curriculums and policies for SRE; each school makes their own policy based on the advice by the government and so each school's curriculum is different. I finalised the topics I want to cover in my project.

I also setup the GitHub repository ready to start prototyping some mechanics. 

Next I spent some more time working on the design document I currently have for my project, adding in some of the ideas from Lloyd and clarifying some features. I spent a good chunk of the week thinking about possible online features besides a leaderboard. I didn't get too far with this and so will need to continue looking into it, but I did come up with the idea of challenges where real-time challenges would take place where the player can gain more points. This left me with some pretty clear features that I could begin implementing.

Also this week I broke down all the features I want to implement into tasks and created a Trello board to add them into. I then went through each feature and determined the most important ones to implement by the Demo submission, the core mechanics of my game. I also begun to plan out in which order to do these in over the six weeks until the demo submission.

### Next Steps
