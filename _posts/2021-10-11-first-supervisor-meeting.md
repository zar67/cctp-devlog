### Tasks
- Have first supervisor meeting with Lloyd
- Research UK SRE curriculum
- Refine objectives into measurable goals
- Research SRE teaching methods
- Research game trends and popular games for inspiration

### Summary
This week started with meeting with Lloyd for an initial meeting, we discussed potential directions for my project as well as suggestions to improve my proposal. Prior to the meeting I sent my proposal to Lloyd to look over and he responded with some suggestions and some ideas for me to consider.

We also discussed possibilities for testing my project; the ethics and requirements behind using school children for user testing mean my project would face some pretty major hurdles and would cause delays. The solution to this would be to conduct user testing with teachers instead, as well as fellow students (of age). 

After the meeting, I collated the list of tasks for me to complete this week (listed above). I also will be consistantly working on my proposal over the next four weeks until the submission date. This week I will be looking at the suggestions Lloyd has made on my proposal as well as focusing on the Risks and Issues section.
